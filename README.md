BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

SyriaTel, a prominent telecommunications company, is confronting the issue of customer churn. To mitigate financial losses and ensure the company's longevity, this project seeks to create a classification model that predicts customer churn by identifying the patterns and factors associated with it. By leveraging these insights, the company can implement proactive strategies to retain customers and promote sustained growth.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

SyriaTel Telecommunications is committed to connecting people through seamless communication. In their continuous quest for excellence, they have faced the challenge of customer churn. Each lost customer not only represents a severed connection but also threatens the company's financial growth and future. By analyzing the factors and patterns associated with churn and developing an effective classification model to predict it, SyriaTel can implement targeted actions to prevent churn and ensure business continuity.

This analysis explores the patterns and predictors of customer churn at SyriaTel, a leading telecommunications provider. By examining customer usage data, service plans, and interaction history, we employ statistical analysis and machine learning models to identify the primary drivers of churn. The study aims to segment the customer base, assess the impact of various service features on customer retention, and develop a predictive model to identify at-risk customers. The insights gained from this analysis will guide targeted interventions to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty, reduce churn rates, and promote long-term business growth.
